# Sales-Management

## Business Objectives
* We need to improve our Internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboard.
* Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time.
* Seeing as each sales person works on different products and customers, it would be benefical to be able to filter them also.
* We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet and we can compare our values against performance.
* The budget is for 2022 and we ussually look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of sales.

## Business Demand Overview
* Reporter: Sales Manager
* Value of change: Visual dashboard, improve sales reporting and follow up sales force
* Necessary systems: Power BI and CRM System
* Other relevant info: Budgets have been delivered in Excel in 2022
